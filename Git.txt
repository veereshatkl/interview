what is git
------------
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

Features of Git
-----------------
Tracks history
Free and open source
Support non-linear development
Creates backups
Scalable
Supports collaboration
Branching is easier
Distributed development

1.git init
The command git init is used to create an empty Git repository.-----git init

2. git add 
Add command is used after checking the status of the files, to add those files to the staging area.------git add .

3. git commit
The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.----git commit -m “commit message”

4.git status
The git status command tells the current state of the repository.------git status

5. git config
The git config command is used initially to configure the user.name and user.email. ----git config --global user.name “any user name” git config --global user.email <email id>

6.git log
The git log command shows the order of the commit history for a repository------ git log

7. git branch
The git branch command is used to determine what branch the local repository is on.
The command enables adding  new branch ----- git branch branchname
and deleting a branch---- git branch -d branchname

8. git checkout
The git checkout command is used to switch branches, whenever the work is to be started on a different branch.------git checkout <branch_name>

9. git merge
The git merge command is used to integrate the branches together. The command combines the changes from one branch to another branch.------ git merge <branch_name>

10..What Is Git Rebase?
Rebase is one of two Git utilities designed to integrate changes from one branch into another. Rebasing is the process of combining or moving a sequence of commits on top of a new base commit. Git rebase is the linear process of merging.
 
11. git clone
the command downloads the remote repository to the computer. -----git clone <remote_URL>

12.git pull 
The git pull command is used to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
The command "git pull origin master" copies all the files from the master branch of the remote repository to the local repository.-----git pull <branch_name> <remote URL>

13. git push
The command git push is used to transfer the commits or pushing the content from the local repository to the remote repository.------git push -u origin master

14.git fetch
The Git fetch command only downloads new data from a remote repository.----- git fetch -all
 
15. git stash
The git stash command takes your modified tracked files and saves it on a pile of incomplete changes that you can reapply at any time. To go back to work, you can use the stash pop.
The git stash command will help a developer switch branches to work on something else without committing to incomplete work.
# Store current work with untracked files
  git stash -u

# Bring stashed work back to the working directory
  git stash pop

18.  What is the functionality of git clean command? 
The git clean command removes the untracked files from the working directory.

20. What exactly is git cherry-pick?
A command typically used to move specific commits from one branch of a repository to another.
$git cherry-pick commit-id

21. What is conflict in Git and how overvome this problem?
git merge conflicts occur when two developers  make changes in the same file, then we can't merge a file into a specific branch. Then, two developers will connect and discuss which data should be kept and which data should be removed. then we will run git commands like git add, git commit.

22. What is the command used to fix a broken commit?
To fix a broken commit in Git, you may use the “git commit --amend” command, which helps you combine the staged changes with the previous commits instead of creating an entirely new commit.

24). Types of version control systems: 
Local version control systems have a database that maintains all the file changes on disk under revision control in a special format.
Centralized version control systems contain one repository, and each user gets their own working copy.
Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories, each accessible to separate users with their own working copy.

25). Difference between git and svn ?
Git has a distributed architecture, while SVN is centralized. Both are enterprise-grade version control systems, with Git positioned as more of a source code management (SCM) tool while SVN acts more as a revision control system.

26). what is .gitignore file
The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

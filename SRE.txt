Key Responsibilities of an SRE
Maintain high availability (HA) of critical applications and infrastructure.
Define and monitor Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Set up real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting using tools like LogicMonitor, Splunk, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK.
Automate repetitive tasks using PowerShell, Bash, Python, Terraform, and Ansible.
Use GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux) to manage Kubernetes deployments.
Ensure zero-downtime deployments through blue-green, canary, and rolling updates.
